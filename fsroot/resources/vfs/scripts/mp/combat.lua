-- M5 combat hub (GLOBAL context; wired from scripts/mp/global.lua).
-- See server/PROTOCOL.md §M5. Authority model (TES3MP-equivalent): the ATTACKER's client
-- detects the hit, the VICTIM's owner applies it. Raw PRE-mitigation damage travels; armor,
-- difficulty, resistances and sounds are applied exactly once on the victim by the engine's
-- own untouched combat pipeline (files/data-mw/scripts/omw/combat/local.lua).
--
-- Outbound: puppet.lua registers an I.Combat onHit handler on every puppet (remote players
-- and remote-authority NPCs). Because handlers run last-registered-first
-- (openmw_aux.util.callEventHandlers iterates in reverse) and our script attaches at
-- runtime, ours runs FIRST and returns false — cancelling all local damage — after
-- forwarding the raw attack here.
-- Inbound: we re-emit the stock `Hit` local event on the real victim, so the builtin
-- pipeline runs verbatim for our own player and for actors under our authority.
