-- Attached by global.lua via obj:addScript('scripts/mp/puppet.lua', {playerId=<u16>}) for

-- authority holder. Consumes MP_Pose events (routed per-puppet from MP_MoveBatch /
-- ActorMoveBatch) into an interpolation buffer and STEERS toward the 100 ms-delayed target
-- through self.controls — the engine's own movement solver drives animation/collision, so
-- puppets walk/run/jump like real actors instead of gliding between set positions. On
-- divergence it asks global.lua for a teleport via mpSnapRequest.

-- solver produces real walk/run animation, collision and footing.
--
-- MID and FAR stop driving controls entirely and reposition instead. This is the whole
-- saving: an actor that is never commanded to move stands in an idle animation and does no
-- per-frame movement solve, whereas a steered one runs the character controller, blends
-- locomotion animation and sweeps physics every single frame. What it costs is smooth
-- motion for that avatar — which is why the thresholds widen with distance, where a
-- reposition covers fewer pixels and reads as normal movement.

-- second measured WORSE than doing nothing clever at all, because ~30 actors/second were
-- being re-placed in the world. The saving comes from repositioning RARELY, not from
-- skipping the character controller, so a tighter threshold does not buy accuracy: it buys
-- a slower client.
--
-- The absolute figures that observation was first made against were taken on a contended
-- box and were an order of magnitude too high; see server/README.md for the corrected
-- idle-box numbers (0.177 ms/avatar fully simulated vs 0.086 ms with the cap). The ORDERING
-- held up on re-measurement — frequent repositioning is still the expensive path — which is
-- why these thresholds stay wide.
