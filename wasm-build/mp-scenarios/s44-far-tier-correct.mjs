// s44 (Phase G): FAR-TIER CORRECTNESS. The render-LOD win is large — a far-tier avatar
// costs ~0.06ms of frame time against ~1.22ms for a fully simulated one — and it is bought
// by not driving the character controller at all. That makes it a cheat unless the avatar
// still ends up in the RIGHT PLACE: an optimisation that lets remote players drift is not a
// cheaper renderer, it is a broken one, and every capacity number resting on it is void.
//
// Same shape as s10 (which covers the near-tier default), but with lodRadius = 0 so both
// clients see each other as FAR. The tolerance is looser on purpose — far tier repositions
// on a wide threshold instead of walking, so the puppet is expected to lag and then jump —
// but it is a FIXED bound, not "whatever it happened to do".

// 16000 was not enough and the failure looked like a movement bug for a while. The harness
// 'walk:' command hardcodes run = false (player.lua), so this is a WALK at roughly 115
// units/sec -- 16s covers ~1840 units against an assertion demanding 2400, which no healthy
// build could ever pass. Sized off the measured rate with margin rather than trimmed to just
// clear it, because walk speed varies with the character's stats.
