// s42 (Phase D): CROWDED CELL. Every real browser client the machine can host, plus a wave
// of protocol bots, all in ONE retail cell — the case the spread-across-cells soak never
// touches and the one this project's inherited TES3MP design is weakest at (one client
// simulates every NPC in a cell and broadcasts to everyone else; TES3MP #701 reports
// non-authority clients getting broken combat gamestate under exactly this shape).
//
// What is asserted, in order of what actually matters:
//   1. Exactly ONE authority holder for the shared cell, with every other client told who.
//   2. Non-holders are really PUPPETING the cell's actors (puppetedActors > 0). Without
//      this, step 3 is meaningless: two clients running independent AI from identical
//      spawns agree by luck, and a convergence check in this repo has already passed once
//      with ZERO puppets attached.
//   3. Cross-client agreement on shared actor positions holds WHILE the cell is crowded —
//      measured before the bots arrive and again at full load, so the report can say
//      whether crowding degrades correctness rather than just whether it passed.
//
// Client count is machine-bound, not spec-bound: each retail client pins ~1.5 GB and boots
// are serialized by the harness. Override with S42_CLIENTS / S42_BOTS.
//
// RETAIL DATA REQUIRED (the clean Example Suite ships no NPCs at all — see s40).

//
// Measured across runs: 148 units (4 bots), 93 (12), 249 (20). Large, variable, and only
// loosely related to crowd size, which is the signature of frame-time-induced steering lag
// on the non-holder rather than a desync that grows with load. An earlier version of this
// constant was set to 250 — directly on top of an observed 249 — which is a fit, not a
// bound, and would flake on the next noisy run. It has real headroom now.
//
// The QUALITY question is answered by reporting the number every run (see the log line
// below) and by PLAYTEST.md, not by this constant. Tightening it to chase the measured
// value would only convert a known limitation into an intermittent test failure.
//
// It cannot cause STATE divergence: M5 routes every actor hit to the authority holder, and
// the holder applies damage from its own state (core/combat.ts), so two clients can never
// end up disagreeing about an NPC's health.

// It is NOT purely cosmetic either, and the honest version matters. The ATTACKER detects
// its hit locally, against the puppet it can see. At 1-2 m of error a player can swing where
// the NPC appears to be and have the holder resolve that swing somewhere else — aim
// fidelity degrades in a crowd even though state stays consistent. That is the real cost of
// crowding a cell, it is bounded here rather than asserted away, and whether it FEELS bad is
// a playtest question (PLAYTEST.md), not something this number settles.
