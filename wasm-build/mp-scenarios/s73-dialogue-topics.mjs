// s73: a dialogue topic one player learns becomes askable for the other.
//
// Why this is shared at all: the JOURNAL already is. A guest's quest state routes through the
// host's journal, so without topic sharing a guest can be looking at a quest in their log and
// have no way to ask anyone about it, because the topic that quest turns on was learned by
// someone else. Sharing the journal and not the topics is the inconsistent position.
//
// TES3MP synced these and is remembered for "server freezes caused by infinite topic packet
// spam". That failure is a LOOP rather than volume -- B applies a topic, B's own diff then
// reads it as something B did not have and sends it back -- so this scenario asserts the loop
// is absent as carefully as it asserts the feature works. A test that only proved delivery
// would pass just as happily on the version that melts the server.
//
// RETAIL, and the reason is worth writing down because the first version of this file asserted
// the opposite. "A topic is just a record id" is wrong: it is a RECORD. addTopic looks the id
// up in the ESM store and throws "topic record not found" if it is not there, and the Example
// Suite ships no Morrowind dialogue at all -- so on demo content the player never learns the
// topic and nothing downstream can possibly work. That is what this scenario found on its first
// run, by checking the LOCAL fact before blaming the network.
