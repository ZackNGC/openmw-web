//
// net.switchTo() records the current world in `currentUrl` and every dial path reads it via
// targetUrl(). If that were wrong — if any path still read mp.getUrl() — a player who joined
// a friend's private session and then had a brief network hiccup would be silently returned
// to the public world they launched into, mid-session, with no error. That is a confusing
// failure a player would report as "it randomly teleported me", so it is worth an explicit
// test rather than trusting the code reads right.
//
// The mechanism is asserted, not the symptom: the client is forced to drop and MUST come
// back on the SESSION world, proven by that world's own /status seeing the player return.
