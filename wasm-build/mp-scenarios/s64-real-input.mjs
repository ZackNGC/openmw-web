// s64: DOES REAL INPUT REACH THE ENGINE? Keyboard and mouse, not a synthetic command.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. "Player cannot attack — combat completely non-functional" was reported from a
// live session while the entire combat suite was green. Both can be true: every combat scenario
// drives `Module.__omwMPCmd='hitn:...'`, which posts the engine's `Hit` event DIRECTLY. A real
// attack is a keypress to ready a weapon and a held mouse button to swing, and nothing in this
// harness could produce either against the game canvas until now. A fault in the INPUT layer
// rather than the combat layer would therefore leave every test passing and the game unplayable.
//
// Two other reports point the same way — "escape must be pressed twice to open the menu" and
// "intermittent random mouse movement spinning the camera" — which is what makes input the single
// hypothesis covering the most of that list.
//
// This deliberately does NOT assert that an NPC takes damage: aiming at one from a headless
// client is not something this harness can do honestly. It asserts the narrower thing that
// actually distinguishes the two explanations — that a real keypress and a real mouse button
// change the player's state at all.
