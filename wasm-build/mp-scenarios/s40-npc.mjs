// s40 (M4): shared NPCs under cell authority.
//   1. Two clients in the same retail cell; exactly ONE is the authority holder.
//   2. Both see the same content NPCs at (near) the same positions — the non-holder's
//      view is puppet-driven off ActorMoveBatch, so it converges within a bounded error.
//   3. Killing an NPC on the holder kills it on the non-holder (ActorDeath relay) and
//      bumps the SHARED kill tally on both (WorldKillCount -> mp.setDeadCount).
//
// RETAIL DATA REQUIRED: the clean Example Suite ships no NPCs at all (its only active
// actors are the player and MP puppets), so shared-NPC authority cannot be exercised on
// the demo content. Skips cleanly when play/mwdata is absent.

  //
  // This scenario asserts that a CLIENT holds cell authority. That stopped being possible when
  // `worldstate.ts` `canSimulate` became `return p.system === true` — only a sim peer may hold a
  // cell, so this failed with `0 !== 1` and had been failing unnoticed for as long as the wasm
  // engine did not build and the browser suite was not run.
  //
  // It is NOT enough to give it the protocol peer that `s41` and `s52` use
  // (`server/dist/testpeer.mjs`): that peer answers the wire, it does not run OpenMW, so it
  // produces no ActorMoveBatch and the NPC positions this scenario compares never move. What it
  // needs is the NATIVE headless peer (`openmw-simpeer:local`, /usr/local/bin/openmw) running
  // beside the browsers.
  //
  // That is blocked on packaging, not on effort: the peer image is Ubuntu 24.04 (glibc 2.39) and
  // ships no chromium — `apt-cache policy chromium` has no candidate there, it is snap-only —
  // while the harness image is Debian bookworm (glibc 2.36), which cannot run the peer binary.
  // One image needs both. The other route is a second container sharing the harness network
  // namespace, which needs the world port to be predictable rather than ephemeral.
  //
  // SKIPPING rather than failing, because a red result here says "the code is broken" and the
  // truth is "this test describes a model the server no longer has". Set OMW_SIM_PEER=1 once a
  // simulating peer is wired in, and rewrite the assertions for peer-held authority.
  // A SIMULATING peer, or nothing to assert. `canSimulate` is `p.system === true`, so a client
  // cannot hold the cell this scenario compares NPCs in, and the protocol peer in
  // server/dist/testpeer.mjs answers the wire without producing ActorMoveBatch. Needs the real
