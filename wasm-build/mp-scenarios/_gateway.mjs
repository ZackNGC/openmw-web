// Shared setup for scenarios that need a REAL gateway supervising real worlds.
//
// It exists because getting this right took four separate corrections, every one of which
// looked like a product defect first (see MP-BACKLOG, "What made the world switch testable"):
// dial the splice only after the world is UP, reach a world THROUGH the gateway, arrive in
// your OWN world rather than public, and set #mphome or a reload makes the client treat
// wherever it landed as home. Anything that switches worlds needs all four, and a fifth
// scenario re-deriving them by hand is how one of them gets missed.
//
// s47, s48 and s57 predate this helper and still inline the same steps. They are left alone
// because they pass, and rewriting a passing scenario to share code is a bad trade.
//
// NOTE: this file starts with an underscore so the harness's scenario scan skips it -- it is
// a library, not a scenario, and a bare .mjs here would be run as one.
