// s58 (M5): AN ATTACK ON A CELL NPC REACHES THE CELL'S OWNER.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Reported from a live server as "hits are not registering, or even showing
// misses". The cause was a contract mismatch: `combat.lua` refused to forward an attack unless
// it already knew the target cell's authority epoch, while `server/src/core/combat.ts` had long
// since stopped requiring one — it validates the epoch only `if (target.epoch !== undefined)`
// and proves presence by proximity instead, precisely because "the attacker is usually a
// NON-holder". The attacker normally IS a non-holder, so this fired in ordinary play.
//
// And it does not lose a message, it loses the SWING: `puppet.lua`'s onHit interceptor has
// already returned false and cancelled the entire local damage chain before the forward is
// even considered. No damage, no miss, no sound. The player swings and the game says nothing.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES AND DOES NOT COVER — checked, not assumed. It covers the JOURNEY: a real
// engine swinging a real weapon-event at a real puppet, through a real server, to the cell's
// real owner. It does NOT isolate the epoch branch, and it was written believing it did:
// reverting the client fix and re-running it still PASSES, because `actors.lua` learns the
// epoch in the same `MP_ActorAuthorityInfo` handler that attaches the puppets, so by the time
// anything is hittable the epoch is already known. The epoch-absent branch needs a puppet whose
// cell the client has no epoch for — an actor that has wandered across a boundary — which no
// deterministic scenario here reproduces. The unit tests in wasm-build/lua-tests cover the
// decision itself and DO fail when the fix is reverted.
//
// Keep the negative control in mind before trusting this scenario to police that fix: it will
// not. It polices the route.
//
// It needs an authority HOLDER, and since `canSimulate` became `p.system === true` only a sim
// peer can be one. No browser scenario could stand one up, which is why s40/s41/s42/s51 all
// fail with `exactly one holder: 0 !== 1` — they were written for client-held authority and
// were quietly retired by that change. This one stands up a peer of its own
// (`server/dist/testpeer.mjs`) rather than asserting a client holds anything.
//
// The peer HOLDS but does not SIMULATE: it answers the protocol, it does not run OpenMW. That
// is exactly enough to assert routing and nothing more, which is all this scenario claims.
