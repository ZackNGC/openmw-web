# Build OpenSceneGraph 3.6.5 for WASM (the hardest dependency).
#
# Prereqs: OSG source at $ROOT/deps/src/osg (branch OpenSceneGraph-3.6.5) with
# wasm-build/patches/osg-emscripten.patch applied:
#   cd deps/src/osg && git apply ../../..//wasm-build/patches/osg-emscripten.patch
#
# The patch contains ALL emscripten fixes: FrameBufferObject.cpp RTT drawBuffers
# (GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT0 vs GL_NONE — do NOT lose this, it un-blanks every RTT camera),
# GLExtensions.cpp (S3TC + packed-depth-stencil forced on), State.cpp (force VBO+VAO),
# Texture.cpp (skip LOD-bias/anisotropy/border-color/swizzle enums invalid on WebGL2),
# tristripper graph_array.h (mem_fun_ref -> lambda; file is latin1-encoded), and the
# fixed-function-emulation touch-ups in Fog/Light/Material/PolygonMode/TexMat.
#
# Key configure facts:
# - -fwasm-exceptions is REQUIRED (throw in a static initializer compiles to
#   `unreachable` without it -> boot trap in __wasm_call_ctors).
# - OSG_CPP_EXCEPTIONS_AVAILABLE=ON (GLES profile defaults it OFF, which kills
#   the png plugin among other things).
# - GL/EGL/GLES libs all point at emscripten's libGL-getprocaddr.a.

# TWO THINGS THE PORT LAYOUT BREAKS, both the same shape as the MyGUI/Freetype fault.
#
# PNG_LIBRARY: under -pthread the emscripten port is built as libpng-mt.a, and CMake's FindPNG
# looks for libpng.a / libpng16.a — so it reports "found version 1.6.58" (the headers) and
# "missing: PNG_LIBRARY" in the same breath, never generates the osgdb_png target, and the
# target list below then dies with "unknown target 'osgdb_png'".
#
# -Wno-register: OSG's flex-generated ConfigLexer.cpp still declares 'register', which C++17
# makes an ERROR rather than a warning. -Wno-deprecated-register is the C++11 spelling and does
# not cover it. This only bites through the "|| ninja" fallback (which builds every plugin) —
# but that fallback is precisely what runs whenever anything above is missing.

# Core libs + the plugins OpenMW links.

# THE SERIALIZERS ARE NAMED EXPLICITLY. The old comment said "osgdb_serializers_osg is many
# targets; build all" and relied on the `|| ninja` fallback to catch them — so whenever the
# explicit list SUCCEEDED they were silently skipped, and OpenMW then failed configure with
# OSGPlugins_osgdb_serializers_osg_LIBRARY=<not found>. A fallback that only runs on failure
# cannot be where a required target lives.
#
# `|| ninja` is kept as a genuine last resort, but it now builds every plugin including ones
# that need -Wno-register (see the flags above).

# for. Staging only the source tree gives a header set that does not describe this build.
