# Bringing multiplayer up on the OVH box

`morrowind.virtastic.app` has run single player since 1.0.x. Multiplayer has never been
provisioned there, so the first `ovhcloud` push needs the box prepared first. Verified on
2026-08-10:

| prereq | state |
|---|---|
| `/opt/openmw-mp/data` | absent |
| `/opt/openmw-mp/data/config.toml` | absent |
| `/opt/openmw-mp/gamedata` (note: NOT under data/) | absent |
| game data for the sim peer | absent |
| `/opt/edge/certs/virtastic.{crt,key}` | present (shared edge already running) |
| shared `edge-caddy` + `nostalgia` network | present |

There is **no** `mp.` subdomain and there never will be. The game page and the gateway are one
origin: `index.html` refuses to hand its session ticket to a gateway whose hostname differs from
the page's, so a separate origin can never receive it. The gateway is reached through the game's
own Caddy at `morrowind.virtastic.app/auth/*`, `/locker/*`, `/saves*`, `/worlds` and `/w/*`. See
AGENTS.md, "One origin".

Pushing `ovhcloud` before these exist runs both workflows. `deploy-mp` would fail its own
healthcheck, and `deploy-ovh` would meanwhile publish a launcher advertising multiplayer and a
cloud locker that cannot work. The order below avoids that.

## 1. OAuth redirect URIs

Each provider console needs the **production** callback added. The dev credentials will not work
against a new origin: providers match the redirect URI exactly.

```
https://morrowind.virtastic.app/auth/google/callback
https://morrowind.virtastic.app/auth/discord/callback
https://morrowind.virtastic.app/auth/microsoft/callback
```

Google Cloud console, Discord developer portal, Azure app registration. Use separate production
credentials rather than reusing the dev ones, so revoking one does not take the other down.

## 2. `/opt/openmw-mp/data/config.toml`

Create the directory and the file. The workflow creates the directory but never writes this
file, and never touches its contents on later deploys.

```toml
[server]
password = "<a long random string>"      # the sim peer authenticates with this

[auth]
requireSso = true                        # forces allowPasswordLogin off. Do not skip this.
returnUrl  = "https://morrowind.virtastic.app/launcher.html"

[auth.google]
enabled = true
clientId = "..."
clientSecret = "..."
redirectUri = "https://morrowind.virtastic.app/auth/google/callback"

# ...and the same three keys for [auth.discord] and [auth.microsoft].

[limits]
trustCloudflareIp = true                 # production IS behind Cloudflare. Do not skip this.

[locker]
endpoint = "https://<ACCOUNT_ID>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com"
region   = "auto"
bucket   = "omw-lockers"

[dev]
bots = 0                                 # the default, stated so nobody wonders
```

The two settings called out above are the ones that are silently wrong if omitted:

- **`requireSso = true`**: without it, account and password login stays open beside SSO. It is
  invisible in the UI, because the launcher only draws SSO buttons. The server warns at boot
  (`frontdoor.password_login_open`).
- **`trustCloudflareIp = true`**: without it, every player resolves to the Cloudflare edge
  address, so `loginPerMinPerIp = 5` applies to the whole player base at once and the sixth
  person to sign in in a minute is refused. The server logs `net.client_ip_mode` at boot.

Mode `600`, owned by whoever the container runs as, or the container cannot read it and dies at
`loadConfig`.

## 3. S3 credentials

These go in the environment, never the config file. `server/docker-compose.prod.yml` loads them
from **`/opt/openmw-mp/data/s3.env`** (under `data/` because the workflow never touches that
dir — same convention as the test server's `/opt/openmw-mp-test/data/s3.env`, which holds the
same keys). Mode `600`, owned by the container user (uid 1001):

```bash
sudo sh -c 'umask 077; cat > /opt/openmw-mp/data/s3.env' <<'EOF'
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
EOF
sudo chown 1001:1001 /opt/openmw-mp/data/s3.env
```

**Do not skip this.** With an endpoint configured but no keys, the server used to fall back to
filesystem storage with a single info line — and filesystem uploads travel through Cloudflare,
whose free-plan 100 MB body cap silently kills every BSA/media upload at the edge. Production
shipped that way once. The server now logs `locker.s3_creds_missing` at error level and
`deploy-mp` fails its health gate on it, so the deploy goes red instead of quietly degrading.

## 4. Game data for the sim peer

The sim peer is a headless OpenMW and needs real game data. Drop it in
`/opt/openmw-mp/gamedata` - NOT `/opt/openmw-mp/data/gamedata`. docker-compose.prod.yml mounts
`/opt/openmw-mp/data:/data` and then overlays `/opt/openmw-mp/gamedata:/data/gamedata:ro`, so
anything placed under `data/gamedata` is shadowed and the server reports the directory empty.
Without game data it refuses to boot, deliberately: a peer with no data silently simulates
nothing.

Also set, or the locker hands players presigned URLs pointing at 127.0.0.1:

```toml
[locker]
publicBase = "https://morrowind.virtastic.app"
```

## 5. Then deploy

```bash
git push origin main:ovhcloud
```

Watch both workflows. `deploy-mp` ends with a healthcheck that connects a bot over the real
WebSocket, so a green run means the server actually accepts a session rather than merely
starting.

## 6. The file-mode upload host (one-time box setup)

S3 mode needs none of this — presigned URLs go straight to object storage. But **file mode**
(no S3 keys; blobs in `/data/locker-blobs`) hands out URLs on the game's own origin, which is
proxied by Cloudflare — and the free plan rejects request bodies over 100 MB at the edge, so
`Morrowind.bsa` (~310 MB) can never upload. The workaround is a second hostname that Cloudflare
never touches: `upload.virtastic.app`, unproxied (grey cloud — this deliberately publishes the
origin IP), on port `8443` so `443` stays Cloudflare-only in the box firewall.

The vhost itself (`deploy/upload.virtastic.app.caddy`) is installed by `deploy-mp` like any
other deploy artifact. The one-time pieces on the box:

1. **DNS**: unproxied `A` record `upload` → the VPS IP (the zone-scoped Cloudflare token can
   do it).
2. **Cert**: browsers connect here directly, so the Cloudflare Origin CA cert will not do —
   it needs a real Let's Encrypt cert, and inbound 80/443 are Cloudflare-only, so use DNS-01:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install -y certbot python3-certbot-dns-cloudflare
   # /root/.secrets/cloudflare.ini (mode 600): dns_cloudflare_api_token = <zone token>
   sudo certbot certonly --dns-cloudflare \
        --dns-cloudflare-credentials /root/.secrets/cloudflare.ini \
        -d upload.virtastic.app --non-interactive --agree-tos -m <you>
   ```

   A deploy hook at `/etc/letsencrypt/renewal-hooks/deploy/upload-edge.sh` copies the cert to
   `/opt/edge/certs/upload.{crt,key}` and restarts `edge-caddy` on each renewal.
3. **Port**: add `"8443:8443"` to the edge Caddy's `ports:` in `/opt/edge/docker-compose.yml`
   and `docker compose up -d`. The `DOCKER-USER` firewall chain only restricts 80/443, so
   8443 is publicly reachable without touching it.
4. **Config**: point file-mode presigned URLs at the new host in
   `/opt/openmw-mp/data/config.toml`:

   ```toml
   [locker]
   publicBase = "https://upload.virtastic.app:8443"
   ```

`publicBase` is ignored in S3 mode, so this is safe to leave set permanently: staging the S3
keys switches the locker to direct-to-S3 and this host simply goes quiet.

## 7. Verify before announcing

```bash
ci/jenkins/verify-mp-hardening.sh https://morrowind.virtastic.app 10
```

Then confirm by hand, because nothing automated covers it: sign in with a real provider account,
upload a copy of Morrowind through the wizard, and play. That path uses SSO plus the locker, and
the browser harness authenticates with a password instead, so it is the one part of the funnel
that has never been exercised end to end.

Also check the boot log says what you expect:

```bash
docker logs openmw-mp 2>&1 | grep -E "client_ip_mode|password_login_open|devbots.enabled"
```

Expected: `trustCloudflareIp: true`, and no `password_login_open` or `devbots.enabled` lines.
