// F3 — the directory a client talks to before it knows which world to dial.
//
// Deliberately small and deliberately NOT a proxy. It hands back a host:port and the client
// connects straight to that world. Proxying every frame through a gateway would put the
// whole platform's movement traffic through one Node event loop, which is exactly the
// bottleneck process-per-world exists to avoid.
//
//   GET  /worlds            list joinable worlds (public always; private/party by owner)
//   POST /worlds            create-or-join a private/party world, returns where to dial
//   GET  /worlds/:id        one world
//   GET  /healthz
//
// AUTH IS NOT DONE HERE and this is important: the gateway does not verify accounts. Each
// world already authenticates on its own WebSocket (SessionHello -> Authing), so a client
// that learns a port still cannot join without credentials. What the gateway must not do is
// LEAK private world ids to people who were not invited, which is why listing filters on the
// caller-supplied account and why that is only a listing filter, never an access control.
