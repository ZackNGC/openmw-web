// F3 — the world supervisor: many world PROCESSES, one directory in front of them.
//
// WHY PROCESSES AND NOT ONE PROCESS WITH MANY WORLDS. Not only because Node is
// single-threaded (that is the performance half). `core/authority.ts` keeps its tuning in a
// module-level singleton that `configureAuthority()` MUTATES, and `metrics` is a module
// singleton too. Two worlds sharing a process would share both: the last world to boot
// would silently retune every other world's authority election, and no metric could be
// attributed to a world. Process-per-world is a correctness boundary, not a preference.
//
// This is also what makes a sim peer PER SESSION real: each world process runs its own
// SimPeerSupervisor (H4), so a private session that spawns a world gets a headless peer with
// it, and reaping the world reaps the peer.
//
// The lifecycle mirrors core/simpeer.ts deliberately — cap, idle reap, crash backoff — for
// the same reason: a world per party is how a box runs out of memory if nothing reaps.
