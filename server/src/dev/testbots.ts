// DEV/TEST BOTS — fake players that accept friend requests and party invites.
//
// For exercising the social flows (and recording them) without a second human. A bot is an
// ordinary roster entry whose Peer, instead of writing to a socket, watches for the two
// "someone wants something from you" events and answers them through the SAME
// social.handleEvent path a real client uses. Nothing in core/social.ts knows bots exist —
// which is the point: a bot taking a private shortcut would prove the shortcut works, not the
// feature.
//
// OFF UNLESS DELIBERATELY SWITCHED ON. These occupy real roster slots and write real
// friend/party rows, so a public server running them hands strangers accounts nobody
// controls. [dev] bots = 0 by default; OMW_DEV_BOTS=<n> for a throwaway run. Boot logs a
// warning whenever any are running, because "why is Bot1 my friend" should never be a mystery.
