// Phase 3.5/3.55: the game-data storage locker.
//
// A player uploads their own Morrowind files once and streams them back on any device.
// The legal framing is a PRIVATE BACKUP LOCKER for files the user already owns, and the
// mechanics below are not implementation details — they are what makes that framing true
// (docs/LEGAL.md §2). Changing any of them re-opens the takedown pattern that killed DOS
// Zone's browser GTA:
//
//   * per-account prefix, always: gamedata/<accountId>/...
//   * ZERO dedup — each account stores its own bytes. Dedup would turn "their backup" into
//     our master copy, which is the entire distinction.
//   * streaming only to the authenticated owner: no public URLs, no sharing, ever
//   * an upload attestation is recorded before any byte is accepted
//   * the vanilla-manifest gate means we accept only the retail files the user attests to
//     owning, so this cannot become general file hosting
//
// This module is the CONTROL PLANE: attestation, per-file authorization, and manifest
// verification. The bytes themselves go straight between the browser and object storage
// via presigned URLs — routing 4 GB through the relay would be pointless cost and would
// make us the distributor in a way the presigned model does not.
