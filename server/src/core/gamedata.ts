// Tier detection: does this server have usable game data of its own?
//
// THE RELAY SERVER NEEDS NO GAME DATA. Multiplayer — movement, chat, objects, quests, combat,
// friends — works with an empty folder, and always has. Game data buys ONE thing: the sim
// peer (Phase H), which simulates NPCs on the operator's machine instead of in a player's
// browser. So an empty folder degrades to "NPCs simulated by a player's client", never to
// "no multiplayer".
//
//   tier 1  no/invalid game data  -> full multiplayer, client-authority NPCs
//   tier 2  valid game data       -> tier 1 + a sim peer holds the cells
//
// This module ONLY validates and reports. It deliberately does NOT build a content manifest:
// a real client's list starts `builtin.omwscripts`, `openmw-template.omwgame` — both from the
// ENGINE's resources, not from any data folder — so no directory scan can reproduce it. The
// authoritative manifest comes from the sim peer itself (see ContentGate.setAuthoritative).
