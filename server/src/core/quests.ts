// there is no monotonicity check, because quest globals legitimately go both ways.
//
// chargenstate is the tutorial's own progress counter, and it counts DOWN to -1 ("creation
// finished"), so no ordering rule can protect it. Storing it meant a rejoin could write an
// older value back over a finished tutorial, and the Census door then correctly refused to
// let the player out: "I gave the item and clicked duties, and it still says I have to do

// fight over the same variable through the 1 s diff sync — each client re-asserting its
// own value, forever. So the default is INVERTED from M6: a global is character-shadowed
// (stored on the character, never relayed) unless it describes the WORLD rather than a
// character's progress.
//
// The world-shared set is deliberately small and conservative, because the failure modes
// are asymmetric: wrongly sharing a progress global causes the ping-pong above and can
// skip a player's quest; wrongly shadowing a world global only means it does not
// propagate, which reads as vanilla single-player behaviour. Operators extend it via
