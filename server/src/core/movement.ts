// A player with no cellKey yet is visible to nobody (the client sends PlayerCellChange
// right after Ready).
//
// M9 capacity: cell-granular visibility alone makes one busy cell an N x N pose mesh, and
// the binding constraint at 64 co-located players is CLIENT cost (render + interpolate 63
// avatars on top of the NPCs), not bandwidth. So on top of the cell rule this module adds
// interest management (distance culling with hysteresis and a nearest-K floor) and LOD
// (send rate as a function of distance). Both shrink what each client must draw.

// 7168 units (components/settings/categories/game.hpp — capped deliberately, bug #1876) while
// an exterior cell is 8192 units wide (Constants::CellSizeInUnits). A peer therefore cannot
// tick actors across a whole neighbouring cell no matter what it has loaded: most of that
// block is outside its processing radius. Claiming it anyway produces a cell with a holder
// that never simulates it — players standing there watch frozen NPCs while the server reports
// the cell as healthily held, and authority.silent_peer cannot catch it because the peer IS
// producing frames, just for other cells.
//
// An unheld cell is visible and fixable. A silently unsimulated one is neither.
//
// ponytail: one cell per ANCHOR — which is not the same as one cell per peer, and the
// difference matters. A peer takes a LIST of anchors (server.ts simPeerPass), so a single
// process covers every occupied cell in the world; coverage costs anchors, which are cheap,
// not processes, which are not. Widening an anchor's reach beyond its own cell needs the peer
// placed at the cell CENTRE (half-diagonal 5793 < 7168, so the anchor is fully covered) and a
// real measurement of what its processing radius reaches — not an assumption about what is
// loaded.
