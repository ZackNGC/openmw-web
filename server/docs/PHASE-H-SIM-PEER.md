# Phase H — server-side simulation (headless authority peer)

**Goal.** Actor simulation moves off players' browsers and onto a machine the operator
controls, for public worlds, private sessions and parties alike, spun up on demand.

**Why it is worth doing.** It fixes a whole class of problem at the root rather than
mitigating it: no player carries anyone else's load, no election or handoff, no frozen NPCs
when someone's tab is loading — and, most importantly, **a modified client can no longer
author NPC state for everyone else**, which is the single largest anti-cheat hole in the
current design.

**Why it is not free.** Simulating Morrowind requires Morrowind's engine and data. This is
not a server rewrite; it is running a real OpenMW instance with rendering disabled. TES3MP
kept simulation on clients for exactly this reason, so treat "just make the server
authoritative" as a claim to be proven, not assumed.

---

## H1 — SPIKE FIRST (gating, ~1 day)

**Nothing below is worth planning in detail until this answers yes.**

0. **Can the repo even build OpenMW natively?** `deps/` currently holds only the wasm
   sysroot and there is no `build-native`. A native build needs OSG, Bullet, MyGUI, ICU and
   friends first, which on this machine is hours, not minutes. Budget it, or evaluate
   running the EXISTING wasm build under Node instead (it hits the same GL question, so the
   crux below is unchanged either way).
1. **Can OpenMW initialise without a GL context?** It is not built for headless operation and
   much of its startup assumes a window and a renderer. Options in increasing desperation:
   an offscreen context (EGL/OSMesa), a null OSG graphics context, or patching the render
   path out of the boot sequence. The spike's job is to find which is needed and how invasive
   it is.
2. **Does it still simulate with no renderer?** AI, pathfinding, physics and MWScript must
   run. A build that boots headless but does not tick actors is worthless.
3. **What does it cost?** RSS and CPU for one instance simulating one world's active cells.
   This number decides whether per-session peers are affordable at all (see H4).

### What a first read of the engine suggests (analysis, NOT proof)

Two things make this look more tractable than "OpenMW has no headless mode" implies, and the
spike should test them directly rather than starting from scratch:

- **The frame is already three separable traversals.** `engine.cpp` runs
  `mViewer->eventTraversal()`, `updateTraversal()`, then `renderingTraversals()`. The world,
  physics and AI tick in the update traversal; drawing is the third call. A headless mode may
  be as narrow as *skipping the third* — simulation without any GPU work per frame.
- **The GL dependency is concentrated at INIT, not per frame.** `createWindow()` runs early in
  `prepareEngine()` and everything that matters — Lua, `MWWorld::World`, physics, the script
  manager — is constructed after it. So the likely shape is: a HIDDEN window with a real
  (software) GL context so `RenderingManager` can construct, then skip rendering every frame.

If that holds, the patch is small and targeted rather than deep surgery on the render path.
It also means the peer pays for a GL context once at startup and no per-frame draw cost,
which matters a great deal for the per-peer cost in H4.

**Treat all of the above as a hypothesis to falsify.** It is a read of the call order, not a
working build, and this project has already had one confident mechanism turn out wrong.

Exit criteria: a headless build that loads a cell, ticks NPCs for a minute, and reports its
RSS/CPU. If that cannot be reached in about a day, stop and reconsider — D-cap-5 (splitting
authority across players) becomes the fallback, and the current model still works.

# RESULT: Phase H is BUILT and PROVEN (2026-07-27)

All of H1-H4 landed. What follows below this banner is the original plan, kept for the
reasoning; this section is what actually happened.

**H1 — headless.** Yes. Two edits behind `OPENMW_HEADLESS=1`: hide the SDL window at
`createWindow()` (a real GL context is still made, so `RenderingManager` constructs), and
skip `renderingTraversals()` per frame (simulation runs in `updateTraversal()`, untouched).
GL is paid once at init, zero per frame.

**Measured cost, macOS/arm64, full retail data with BSAs registered, host load ~5:**

| | RSS | CPU |
| --- | --- | --- |
| rendering baseline | 259 MB | ~15.5% of one core |
| headless | 362 MB | ~8.8% of one core |

So a peer is ~360 MB + ~9% of a core. On the 23 GB / 8-core VPS that is dozens of
concurrent peers; one public-world peer is trivial.

> **SUPERSEDED — this is the macOS figure.** Measured on Linux/x86-64 with full retail data on
> 2026-08-24 the peer is **468–487 MB**, not ~360 MB, and the number that actually sizes a host
> is per WORLD (peer + its node process ≈ 623 MB), not per peer. See "EXERCISED 2026-08-24"
> below. The "dozens of concurrent peers" conclusion also does not survive contact with the
> gateway: worlds multiply the peer's cost, which is what `[worlds] memBudgetMb` exists for.

**H2 — native transport.** A dependency-free RFC 6455 client (`ws://` only; TLS is the
browser edge's problem). The threading contract was the real work: `NetManager`'s callbacks
mutate its state inline and are only safe because emscripten delivers them between frames,
so the native side queues events on its reader thread and `WebSocket::poll()` — once per
frame, no-op in the browser — fires them on the main thread.

**H3 — peer as authority.** Needed no new protocol: the peer declares `simulatesActors` and
wins the existing election. Plus a `system` identity (invisible in playerCount, /status,
PlayerList and maxPlayers; join/leave suppressed so no client puppets it), fallback to a
capable human if it dies, and the anti-cheat proof below.

**H4 — orchestration.** `core/simpeer.ts`: spawner, hard cap, idle reaper, crash backoff.
Wired at one point (a 5 s tick on `roster.humansInWorld()`), not paired join/leave hooks —
a missed leave would strand a peer forever, which is the exact leak the reaper defends
against. Proven with the real binary end to end:

```
human joins  -> simpeer.spawned -> peer connects, join_world system:true
human leaves -> world idle
+20s         -> simpeer.reaped (idleMs=20003) -> SIGTERM -> clean leave, no orphan
```

## The anti-cheat claim, made concrete

Previously an argument; now a negative-controlled test. A non-holder forging an
`ActorMoveBatch` for a cell it does not own is **rejected**, **counted**
(`omwmp_actor_batch_rejected_total{reason="not_holder"}`, so forgery is visible in
`/metrics` instead of silent), and **relayed to nobody** — while the real holder's batch
still reaches the same victim, proving the check discriminates rather than the stream being
dead. Remove the holder check and it fails.

## Content validation (added 2026-07-27)

The server can now own its world's content list rather than adopting whichever stranger
connects first. Worth recording HOW, because the obvious approach does not work.

**A server cannot derive the content list.** Captured from a real client:
`builtin.omwscripts#0, openmw-template.omwgame#1, land.esp#2, examplesuite.omwaddon#3,
mp.omwscripts#4`. Entries 0 and 1 live in the ENGINE's resources, not in any data folder, so
neither a directory scan nor an `openmw.cfg` parse can reproduce them — both would refuse
100% of clients. Two successive plan drafts proposed exactly that; a one-line temporary log
plus one `s01` run killed the idea before it was built.

**So the sim peer reports it.** The peer is a real engine running the server's data, so its
list is computed by the same code as every player's client — correct by construction. It is
pinned only after the peer's OWN content check passes, so a misconfigured peer cannot install
a broken canonical and lock everyone out.

**`strict` now means something.** It compares per-file sha256 in addition to names and order,
which is the difference between "you must have the same mod list" and "you must have the same
files". Archives are deliberately excluded: content files are ~90 MB and already read in full
at load, while BSAs are ~471 MB streamed on demand, so hashing them would force a full
download to protect meshes and textures. NOT usable yet — no client sends hashes until the
`mp.getContentHashes` engine binding exists, so enabling strict today refuses everyone.

## What is still NOT true, stated plainly

- ~~**"Public, private and party" maps to one world per process today.**~~ **SUPERSEDED.**
  F3 landed: `gateway/worlds.ts` supervises world processes and each one runs its own
  `SimPeerSupervisor`, so a peer per session comes with the world. That has a consequence this
  document originally got backwards — see the note below.
- ~~**Linux/displayless is unexercised.**~~ **EXERCISED 2026-08-24.** The `tier2` image
  (`server/Dockerfile.simpeer`) was built and run on x86-64 Linux in a container with no display
  of any kind. It booted with full retail Morrowind + Tribunal + Bloodmoon, reached
  `SessionHello` in **11.4 s** (`simpeer.ready startupMs=11357`), and anchored the cell its
  player was standing in — no `SDL_VIDEODRIVER=offscreen`, no EGL/OSMesa fallback needed.

  **Measured RSS, host load 1.4:** sim peer **487 MB**, world process **136 MB**, gateway
  process **118 MB**. So one occupied world is **623 MB**, against the 780 MB this document's
  arithmetic had assumed — wrong in both halves, the node process much smaller and the peer
  larger. `[worlds] worldCostMb` is now 640 and derived from this rather than from a comment.
- **Player self-movement is still client-authored** — deliberately (see H5). The peer makes
  validating it possible for the first time; that is follow-on work, not done.
- **The cost figure is one machine, one cell set.** Still true of the 2026-08-24 Linux
  measurement above: one player, one exterior cell, an idle box. A peer anchoring several busy
  cells will cost more, and that has not been measured.

### H1 result so far (build side proven; runtime pending)

The native toolchain question is answered: OpenMW **configures and is compiling** natively on
this machine (macOS/arm64), tools off. What it took, all local and gitignored:
- double-precision Bullet from `deps/src/bullet3` (brew's is single; OpenMW rejects it),
- MyGUI 3.4.3 from `deps/src/mygui` (no brew formula),
- one upstream CMake guard: the macOS Qt-plugin bundling block ran under `if (APPLE)` and had
  to become `if (APPLE AND USE_QT)`, since a tools-off build has no Qt targets. Committed.

### The headless patch, located precisely (to apply once the binary runs)

Reading `apps/openmw/engine.cpp` confirms the two-part hypothesis and pins where each part
lives, so the patch is small and targeted rather than exploratory:

1. **Init** — `createWindow()` (line ~555) creates the SDL window and a real GL context, and
   everything that simulates (`MWWorld::World`, physics, Lua, scripts) is built AFTER it in
   `prepareEngine()`. A `--headless` path creates the window `SDL_WINDOW_HIDDEN` and keeps a
   real (software) GL context, so `RenderingManager` still constructs. No renderer teardown,
   no null-context surgery.
2. **Per frame** — the frame is `eventTraversal()` / `updateTraversal()` / then
   `renderingTraversals()` at engine.cpp:407-419 (and the emscripten path at 249-251).
   Simulation is the update traversal; drawing is `renderingTraversals()`. Headless simply
   does not call the third. Under `--headless` the peer pays for a GL context ONCE and does
   zero per-frame GPU work — which is the property H4's per-peer cost depends on.

Still to prove at runtime, in order: (a) the hidden-window context actually creates under a
software GL on a machine with no display attached (the real deployment target); if not, fall
back to an EGL/OSMesa surfaceless context. (b) NPCs actually tick with the third traversal
skipped. (c) RSS/CPU for one instance holding one world's active cells.

## H2 — native WebSocket transport

`apps/openmw/mwmp/websocket.cpp` wraps the **emscripten** WebSocket API; on native builds
every method is a deliberate no-op so the tree still compiles for desktop. A headless peer
therefore cannot connect at all today.

Add a native implementation behind the same `MWMP::WebSocket` interface (IXWebSocket or
Boost.Beast; the interface is already narrow — open, send text, send binary, close, four
callbacks). The browser path must be left exactly as it is: it is proven, and this is
additive.

## H3 — the peer as an authority client

The peer connects like any other client and **needs no new protocol**: cell authority already
requires `simulatesActors: true` (added when protocol-only bots were found winning elections
and freezing cells). A local peer declares it, has near-zero RTT, and wins every election
through the existing fitness path.

What it does need:

- **A system identity.** Not in the player list, not kickable, not counted against
  `maxPlayers`, exempt from the idle/AFK paths.
- **Preference, not a guarantee.** If the peer dies, the existing election must still fall
  back to a capable player client. The peer is an upgrade, not a hard dependency — a
  self-hoster with no game data on the server must still get a working game.
- **Liveness already covered.** A peer that stops producing loses its cells through the
  guard that already exists.

## H4 — on-demand orchestration (public, private, party)

This is the requirement that makes Phase H big, and it revives E1.

| mode | peer lifetime |
| --- | --- |
| public world | one long-lived peer, started with the world |
| private session | started when the session is created, reaped when empty |
| party | same as private, keyed on the party |

**AND THAT MEANS WORLDS MULTIPLY THE PEER'S COST.** `[simPeer] maxPeers` is per world process,
so it can never govern the box — it cannot see its siblings. The gateway's `maxWorlds` was for
a time derived from `[server] maxPlayers` on the explicit reasoning that peers were capped
separately and "worlds do not multiply the peer's cost", which is the opposite of what this
table says. See `[worlds] memBudgetMb` and `gateway/worlds.ts capacity()`.

**One peer covers a whole world, not a 3x3 block.** The peer takes an anchor LIST
(`SimAnchors` -> `Scene::setSimAnchors`), one anchor per occupied cell, so 200 players spread
across the map are simulated from a single process. `movement.ts loadedCells()` returns ONE
cell: OpenMW clamps actor processing to 7168 units, narrower than an 8192-unit cell, so a peer
cannot tick actors across a neighbouring cell no matter what it has loaded.

**Cost per peer is the deciding number and it is currently unknown** — H1 measures it. A full
OpenMW instance with game data loaded is likely hundreds of MB, so "one per party" may be
affordable at ten sessions and not at a hundred. Design the reaper before the spawner:
per-user session caps and idle reaping are day-one requirements, because the cost model goes
from one process to N.

Cheaper variants to price if the per-peer cost is high:
- **One peer, many worlds** — a single instance simulating several sessions' cells, if the
  engine can hold multiple worlds at once (it probably cannot; check before assuming).
- **Peer only for the public world**, with private/party sessions keeping client authority.
  Most of the anti-cheat value lives in the public world anyway.

## H5 — what this buys for anti-cheat, precisely

Worth being exact, because "server authoritative" is often claimed too broadly.

**Closed by this work:**
- NPC positions, AI state and deaths stop being author-able by a player's client.
- Actor combat resolution moves to the operator's machine: M5 routes actor hits to the
  authority holder, and the holder becomes the peer.

**Not closed, and not by this alone:**
- **Player self-movement stays client-authored.** That is deliberate — it is what makes the
  game feel responsive, and making the server authoritative over input is a much larger
  change that would hurt play more than it helps. The peer *can* now validate it (it has
  collision and speed data), so speed/teleport/no-clip checks become possible for the first
  time; that is a follow-on, not part of H3.
- Client-reported player stats and inventory remain trusted within the existing plausibility
  caps.

So: this closes the largest hole and makes a second class of check possible. It does not make
the game cheat-proof, and the docs should not claim it does.

## Sequencing

1. **H1 spike** — gating. Everything else is speculative until it lands.
2. **H2 native transport** — well-understood, can proceed in parallel once H1 looks viable.
3. **H3 peer identity + preference + fallback** — small, mostly server-side.
4. **H4 orchestration** — sized by H1's cost number; reaper before spawner.
5. **H5 movement validation** — separate follow-on, only once the peer is real.

## Verification

- A cell's NPCs are simulated with **no player holding authority**.
- Killing the peer falls back to a player client within the existing handoff window, and
  killing it again while a player holds it changes nothing.
- A modified client's forged `ActorMoveBatch` is ignored (it is not the holder), which is
  the anti-cheat claim made concrete rather than asserted.
- Cost per peer published like every other capacity figure: measured on an idle box, with
  the host load recorded.
