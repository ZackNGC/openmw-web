# Usage: deploy-test.sh engine|server
#
# Normally you do NOT run this by hand: it is the last stage of both Jenkins pipelines
# (ci/jenkins/Jenkinsfile.engine and .server), and it runs on every green build. There is no
# build-without-deploy, because an image that was never deployed has never been tested.
#
# TEST_HOST and SSH_KEY are resolved HERE, on the build server, inside the Jenkins container
# -- not on a laptop. An ssh alias from somebody's ~/.ssh/config and a key path under their
# home directory cannot resolve in that container, so config.env must carry a user@host and a
# key the container can actually read ($HOME/.ssh/id_ed25519 works in both places). Getting
# this wrong does not fail loudly: deploys keep working when run by hand and fail only from
# Jenkins, so the job quietly stops being used and images start being built by hand instead.
#
# No registry: `docker save | ssh docker load` over the LAN is fast enough and is one less
# moving part. If deploys get slow enough to annoy, stand up a registry on the build server.
